# The C Programming Language - My Implementation & Learning

## ðŸ“– About This Repository

This repository contains my implementation and learning journey while studying **"The C Programming Language"** by **Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie** (K&R). The code here represents my hands-on practice, solutions to exercises, and exploration of C programming concepts as I progress through the book.

## ðŸ“š Chapters & Implementations

Below is a breakdown of the chapters and what they cover, along with my implementations:

### **Chapter 1: A Tutorial Introduction**
- Basic input/output (`printf`, `scanf`, `getchar`, `putchar`)
- File handling basics
- Control flow (`if`, `while`, `for`, `switch`)
- Basic C program structure

### **Chapter 2: Types, Operators, and Expressions**
- C data types (`int`, `char`, `float`, `double`)
- Arithmetic, relational, and logical operators
- Bitwise operations and shifting
- Type conversions and precedence

### **Chapter 3: Control Flow**
- `if-else`, `switch-case`
- Loops: `while`, `do-while`, `for`
- `break` and `continue`
- `goto` (and why it's discouraged)

### **Chapter 4: Functions and Program Structure**
- Function definitions and declarations
- Scope, storage classes, and linkage
- Header files and modular programming
- Recursion in C

### **Chapter 5: Pointers and Arrays**
- Introduction to pointers
- Pointer arithmetic
- Arrays and pointers
- Pointer vs. array differences
- Strings and character arrays
- Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`)

### **Chapter 6: Structures**
- Defining and using `structs`
- Nested structures
- Pointers to structures
- `typedef` usage

### **Chapter 7: Input and Output**
- File operations (`fopen`, `fclose`, `fgets`, `fputs`, `fprintf`, `fscanf`)
- Command-line arguments
- Error handling in I/O

### **Chapter 8: The UNIX System Interface**
- Low-level file handling (`open`, `close`, `read`, `write`)
- Process control (`fork`, `exec`, `wait`)
- System calls and error handling
